What we will learn in this project ?
- How to setup and connect to the cloud database ?
- How to perform all the CRUD operations ? (CRUD is fundamental to any application)
- You are going to take care of both the frontend and the backend of this project
- Let me stress something: this is not your typical to-do-list app that stores data 
  on the local storage. Instead, we are wroking with the cloud.
